:::{questions}
- What syntax is used to make a lesson?
- How do you structure a lesson effectively for teaching?
- `questions` are at the top of a lesson and provide a starting
  point for what you might learn.  It is usually a bulleted list.
:::

:::{objectives}
- Show a complete lesson page with all of the most common
  structures.

language for the entire page.
